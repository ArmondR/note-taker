# note-taker

## Description

This application is a note taker app. With the use of node.js, express.js and code terminal, the user is presented with a note recording application.

## Future Development

In future development of this application I would like to finish the functionality of the overall application. The application still needs functionality to query saved notes.

## Usage

The application is deployed via heroku server and the link is provided below or opened via localhost:3001 from local network.
